# 01 T REGISTRO-SAP Validation Automation Project

The T REGISTRO-SAP Validation Automation project is an innovative solution that addresses the tedious and error-prone process of validating TR5 and TR6 data extracted from SUNAT against SAP system information. The project proposes developing an automated system that will validate critical data points, generating a final report with the corresponding validations, reducing manual validation efforts, and increasing processing speed. The scope encompasses the complete process, including extracting information, validating data, and generating the final report. Technical requirements are minimal, and the model has been validated through a review session with auditing personnel. The expected results are reduced validation time, increased efficiency, and processing speed, reducing errors and increasing reliability, resulting in a more efficient and reliable audit process.

# 03 Automated Validation of Payment Slip Certificates Project

The "Automated Validation of Payment Slip Certificates" project aims to develop an automated system that extracts information from PDFs and validates their content against SAP system information. Manual validation of this data is a tedious process prone to errors, which can affect accuracy and consume a significant amount of time. The project will cover the entire validation process of payment slip certificates in PDF format, including extraction of information from PDF reports and SAP master data. The automation process will involve copying PDFs of payment slip certificates from units located in the Z share, and the system will paint the final report green or red based on whether they meet established parameters. The goal is to reduce the time and effort required for manual validation of payment slip certificate data, as well as increase the speed of validation processing and improve efficiency in the process.
